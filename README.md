#  Book Recommendation System

This project is a simple **book recommendation system** built using Python. It suggests books that are similar to each other based on genres, and tags. The final app was made using **Streamlit** so you can see the recommendations in a nice dashboard.

##  What This Project Does

- Loads book data from real-world datasets.
- Cleans and prepares the data.
- Uses **cosine similarity** to find books that are similar.
- Recommends books to users based on one they already like.
- Shows the results in an interactive web app (dashboard).
